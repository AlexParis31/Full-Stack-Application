# Tv-Show Application

## Summary
This full-stack application was built using JavaScript with Express.js and Node.js environments. It is an application that allows the user to create a list of their favorite tv shows and divide them into categories. 

Users can add their desired tv shows by filling out a form that includes: 
..* name of the show
..* cast, network
..* genre
..* personal or public rating
..* a poster image of the show selected through a linked website. 
Once the user submits this form, that information is added to a database on MongoDB which collects all of the users' data.

Users are then able to view this database in a clean display (styled mostly with CSS Flexible Box Layout), and can select different viewing options of the list in order to see the different categories. For example, users can tell the app to only display netflix shows, only display comedies, or only shows that have a rating no lower than 90.
